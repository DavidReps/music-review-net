Needs(research):
more pages on LSTM's 
info on sentiment analysis
info on metrics for rnn's, lstm networks, and nn in general
info on time series
info on vanishing gradient problem(the motivation for lstm's)

Things we can/should do:
train 1 net on just p4k, 1 net on metacritic(homogenous) reviews
-compare performance of both of these on both just p4k and homogenous each
-possible reasons for difference
**p4k has different mean or std dev of scores
**p4k uses a different vocabulary
thus we can also train on the same data, but standardize the scores:
-eliminates possibility that p4k has different mean or std dev of scores


Assorted to do:
comment metacritic scraper-(Gavin)
produce output file from metacrtitic scraper with same format as p4k dataset file
